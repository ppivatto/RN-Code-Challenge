 # Comments:
 1. I couldn't improve the fetching for each score, so to get all of "ingredients", it takes about 4 minutes. So, to view all functionalities, you need to wait these minutes. 
 2. After to waiting the minutes, you can enter in each cocktail, to see more details
 3. You can search for some cocktails, in the searching input text.
 4. To routing, I used React Navigation.  In other projects, I used React Navigation of wix. Sincerely, I don't know which is better for thousands of users. I need to research more info about it. 
 5. To consume the API endpoints, I implemented some utils that I used in other projects, easier to call services.
 6. To optimize the performance of the list generated I implemented some strategies, but I didn't have the expected result (related to promises).
